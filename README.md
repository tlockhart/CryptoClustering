# Cryptocurrency Cluster Analysis

## Summary

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of analyzing cryptocurrency price fluctuations using K-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA). The project focuses on classifying cryptocurrencies based on their price changes over various timeframes, including 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.

By applying these machine learning techniques, the analysis provides insights into patterns and trends in cryptocurrency price movements, offering a basis for further exploration or predictive modeling.
